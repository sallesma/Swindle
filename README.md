Swindle
=============

Just a simple Django app I made to show my friends the danger of using the same password everywhere on the web.

It has never been deployed to production (and probably never will) due to security reasons.

What it does is basically store your data when you register and try to log in on several famous web services...

Test run using fixtures. Edit swindle/webapp/fixtures/users_valid.yaml with valid users so that the tests can pass
